Final Project

John Osborne
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2019

Create a scene a player can navigate in first person with the light of a flashlight

Key bindings
  WASD		 Move Player
  arrows     Change view angle
  N/n		 Enable/Disable Collision Detection
  Shift W    Sprint Forward
  ESC        Exit

  To Run:
  put all included files in one directory
  Run 'make' to generate an executable named 'main', the project requires opengl, glut, and glew to be in the PATH
  Run 'main'

  This took roughly 100+ hours

  The project evolved from a maze into more of an interactive scene. The final project focuses 
  more on highlighting the two per pixel spotlight shaders created to give the illusion of a 
  flashlight and a spinning hazard light.
